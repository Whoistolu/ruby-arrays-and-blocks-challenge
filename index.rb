Creating Arrays

Here are two basic arrays:

num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]

Both arrays have five elements separated by commas. The first array contains integers, while the second array contains strings.

Arrays are commonly created with an array literal, which is simply a special syntax used to create instances of an array object. To create a new array using an array literal, use square brackets ([]).

An array can also be created by calling the Array.new method. When you call this method, you can also include up to 2 optional arguments (initial size and default value):

Array.new               #=> []
Array.new(3)            #=> [nil, nil, nil]
Array.new(3, 7)         #=> [7, 7, 7]
Array.new(3, true)      #=> [true, true, true]

Accessing Elements
Every element in an array has an index, which is a numerical representation of the element’s position in the array. Like most other programming languages, Ruby arrays use zero-based indexing, which means that the index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on. Accessing a specific element within an array is as simple as calling myArray[x], where x is the index of the element you want. Calling an invalid position will result in nil. Ruby also allows the use of negative indices, which return elements starting from the end of an array, starting at [-1].

str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]

str_array[0]            #=> "This"
str_array[1]            #=> "is"
str_array[4]            #=> "array"
str_array[-1]           #=> "array"
str_array[-2]           #=> "small"
Finally, Ruby provides the #first and #last array methods, which should be self-explanatory. In addition, these methods can take an integer argument, e.g., myArray.first(n) or myArray.last(n), which will return a new array that contains the first or last n elements of myArray, respectively.

str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]

str_array.first         #=> "This"
str_array.first(2)      #=> ["This", "is"]
str_array.last(2)       #=> ["small", "array"]

Adding and Removing Elements
Adding an element to an existing array is as simple as using the #push method or the shovel operator <<. Both methods will add elements to the end of an array and return that array with the new elements. The #pop method will remove the element at the end of an array and return the element that was removed.

num_array = [1, 2]

num_array.push(3, 4)      #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
num_array << 5            #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
num_array.pop             #=> 5
num_array                 #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
The methods #shift and #unshift are used to add and remove elements at the beginning of an array. The #unshift method adds elements to the beginning of an array and returns that array (much like #push). The #shift method removes the first element of an array and returns that element (much like #pop).

num_array = [2, 3, 4]

num_array.unshift(1)      #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
num_array.shift           #=> 1
num_array                 #=> [2, 3, 4]
It’s also useful to know that both #pop and #shift can take integer arguments:

num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

num_array.pop(3)          #=> [4, 5, 6]
num_array.shift(2)        #=> [1, 2]
num_array                 #=> [3]

Adding and Subtracting Arrays
What do you think will be the outcome of [1, 2, 3] + [3, 4, 5]?

If you guessed [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5], congratulations! Adding two arrays will return a new array built by concatenating them, similar to string concatenation. The concat method works the same way.

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 4, 5]

a + b         #=> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
a.concat(b)   #=> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
To find the difference between two arrays, you can subtract them using -. This method returns a copy of the first array, removing any elements that appear in the second array.

[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] - [1, 4]  #=> [2, 2, 3]

Basic Methods
Ruby gives you many methods to manipulate arrays and their contents (over 150!), many of which are beyond the scope of this lesson. For full documentation, go to http://ruby-doc.org/, click on “Core API”, scroll down to the Classes section, and click on “Array”. There, you’ll find the most up-to-date documentation on the various methods available to Ruby arrays along with explanations.

As previously mentioned, there are many methods available to Ruby arrays, and the behavior of some methods change depending on a variety of factors, such as if they take arguments or not. Therefore, ruby-doc.org will be your best friend in maximizing your aptitude with arrays. So visit soon, and visit often.

Calling the #methods method on an array will also yield a long list of the available methods.

num_array.methods       #=> A very long list of methods
Here is a brief look at some other common array methods you might run into:

[].empty?               #=> true
[[]].empty?             #=> false
[1, 2].empty?           #=> false

[1, 2, 3].length        #=> 3

[1, 2, 3].reverse       #=> [3, 2, 1]

[1, 2, 3].include?(3)   #=> true
[1, 2, 3].include?("3") #=> false

[1, 2, 3].join          #=> "123"
[1, 2, 3].join("-")     #=> "1-2-3"
